A change to a settled decision is an RFC PR plus a superseding entry, never an edit.

## D-001 — Project name: Stowage

2026-06-10. The memory server joins the Portico/Harbor/Dockyard ecosystem and
needed a dock-vocabulary name. **Stowage** — the storage of cargo aboard a
vessel. The Python predecessor's project name must not appear anywhere in this
repository (naming constraint set by the owner); refer to it as "the Python
predecessor".

## D-002 — Module path `github.com/hurtener/stowage`, repo `Stowage`

2026-06-10. Lowercase module path (Go convention) even though the sibling
Harbor uses a capitalized path; GitHub resolves case-insensitively, and we
prefer the conventional form for a fresh module. Binary name: `stowage`.

## D-003 — Clean-room redesign; no predecessor files

2026-06-10. No code, schema, prompt, or doc files from the Python predecessor
or the CC-memory predecessor are copied or vendored. Ideas transfer through
`docs/research/` briefs written for this repo. Enforced by review +
`drift-audit` forbidden-names check.

## D-004 — Go 1.26, CGo-free shipped binary

2026-06-10. Matches Harbor's toolchain and Dockyard's no-CGo discipline.
`modernc.org/sqlite` for the sqlite driver; `-race` test runs are the only
CGo-enabled builds.

## D-005 — No local models; gateway seam with Bifrost as first driver

2026-06-10. The Python predecessor's local SentenceTransformers + CrossEncoder
stack is the single largest deployment/perf liability. All embeddings and LLM
calls go through `internal/gateway`; first driver targets Bifrost
(OpenAI-compatible), the same gateway Harbor fronts. Future providers are new
drivers, never new call sites (RFC P5).

## D-006 — Fidelity first: verbatim records + provenance drill-down

2026-06-10. Adopted from CL-Bench (brief 04): lossy extraction without a
recovery path is the defining failure of benchmarked memory systems. Verbatim
records are append-only; every memory carries provenance; retrieval exposes
drill-down (RFC P1).

## D-007 — Engram pipeline shape: topics → buffers → extract → reconcile → commit

2026-06-10. Adopted from brief 03. Topics gate extraction (noise never enters);
reconciliation is a constrained tool-call decision; buffers are the multi-agent
write surface; ingest is fire-and-forget (RFC P2, §4.1, §6).

## D-008 — Lifecycle model from the CC-memory predecessor

2026-06-10. Six utility counters, decay with utility-grown stability,
contradiction boost, trust-gated supersede, anticipated-queries lane, hub
dampening, cooldown, quarantine (brief 02). Modification: decay blends
scope-activity turns with wall-clock time to fix the dormant-project blind spot.

## D-009 — Store seam with sqlite + postgres drivers; ~12-table target schema

2026-06-10. Dockyard's interface+factory+driver discipline with a shared
conformance suite. sqlite uses a dedicated writer goroutine (the CC-memory
predecessor documented multi-second lock waits under concurrent writers).
Postgres uses pgx + pgvector. Deliberate schema budget (~12 tables) against the
Python predecessor's 48+.

## D-010 — Identity quadruple and scope enforcement in the store layer

2026-06-10. Scope (tenant/project/user/session) matches Harbor's identity
shape. No unscoped query API exists (RFC P3); hard isolation at tenant/user,
soft scoping below, privacy zones gate promotion/export only.

## D-011 — Doc-driven build methodology inherited from Dockyard

2026-06-10. RFC > phase plans > CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md > briefs > code comments;
phase plans from template with binding acceptance criteria; smoke scripts;
preflight gate; decisions log; glossary; mirror rule. CLAUDE.md adapted from
Dockyard's with project-specific sections retargeted.

## D-012 — Commits unsigned in this repository

2026-06-10. The owner's signing key is work-scoped; this is a personal-account
project. `commit.gpgsign=false` and `tag.gpgsign=false` set in local git
config; identity is the hurtener account.

## D-013 — Private repository; license deferred

2026-06-10. Private under `hurtener/Stowage`. License selection is deferred to
any future publication decision (RFC OQ-5); no LICENSE file until then.

## D-014 — Eval harness is a release gate

2026-06-10. From CL-Bench's gain metric: `stowage eval` ships in-tree, and
negative gain on the standard scenarios blocks release (RFC §12, Phase 17).

## D-015 — Small MCP surface (6 tools)

2026-06-10. Both predecessors grew sprawling surfaces (50+ endpoints / 70+
tools). Stowage's MCP surface is deliberately six tools; additions require an
RFC amendment. *(Amended by D-018: `memory_playbook` makes it seven.)*

## D-016 — Team sharing via grants, not federation

2026-06-11. Fleet use cases need team-level shared memory; the Python
predecessor solved it with federation graphs + RBAC (8+ tables) — too heavy.
Stowage: a **grant** gives a named group read/contribute access to a slice of
an owner scope, capped by privacy-zone ceiling, optional redaction, enforced in
the store layer like scopes (P3). Cross-tenant federation stays out of scope.
RFC §5.3; own phase in Wave 4.

## D-017 — Reconciliation is reversible; rollback API

2026-06-11. Every destructive reconciliation op (update/merge/supersede) must
be invertible from its event within retention: sources kept as `superseded`,
prior content stored on update events, `POST /v1/memories/{id}/rollback`
restores and tombstones with its own event. The LLM gets to be wrong
recoverably. RFC §6; lands with Phase 14.

## D-018 — ACE built in: outcomes, reflection, deterministic playbooks

2026-06-11. From brief 05 (arXiv 2510.04618). Three capabilities: (1)
outcome-tagged ingestion (success/failure + execution feedback; Harbor task
events as the label-free source); (2) a reflection extraction mode producing
`strategy`/`failure_mode` memories, reconciled like any candidate, with a
multi-epoch re-reflection sweep; (3) `GET /v1/playbook` — deterministic,
sectioned, budget-packed assembly with **no LLM in the assembly path**
(context-collapse defense) and append-biased output for prompt caching. Adds
the `memory_playbook` MCP tool (amends D-015). RFC §6a.

## D-019 — Harbor: speak the protocol, don't build on the runtime

2026-06-11. Stowage's core pipeline is channels + supervision, never Harbor
flows/planner (dependency direction: Harbor depends on Stowage; Stowage must
run standalone). Stowage adopts Harbor's protocol surface instead: identity
quadruple, bus-shaped `memory.*` events, `llm.cost.recorded` governance
semantics. Stowage ops appear as tools *inside* Harbor flows (consolidation,
reflection recipes). The eval harness's agent loop runs on Harbor — the
canonical "Harbor powering a non-agent" showcase. RFC §10.

## D-020 — MCP surface built with Dockyard; console as a Dockyard MCP App

2026-06-11. Phase 16 implements `stowage mcp` with Dockyard (contract-first
typed tools, generated schemas, inspector, validate gates) — Stowage becomes
Dockyard's first external consumer. Post-v1, the operator console ships as a
Dockyard MCP App. RFC §9.2.

## D-021 — Postgres is the principal store; sqlite is the embedded driver

2026-06-11. Refines D-009: postgres (pgx + pgvector) is the recommended
production/fleet/managed-cloud driver; sqlite (modernc, pure Go) is the
embedded/portable driver and must remain CGo-free forever. Both pass the same
conformance suite; the seam is the contract and future backends are new
drivers. RFC §8.1.

## D-022 — Embedded library mode is a supported deployment

2026-06-11. `sdk/stowage` in-process mode (full server in the host process, no
daemon, no network) is a first-class deployment, not a test convenience. Target
picture: Harbor agent + Stowage inside a Wails desktop app. This is a standing
reason behind the no-CGo rule. RFC §2.

## D-023 — Open-source gated on SOTA benchmarks; managed cloud is the business

2026-06-11. Strategy: open-source release as an AI-first capability showcase,
gated on a reproducible report showing state-of-the-art results on public
memory benchmarks (LoCoMo-style ≥ 0.86, CL-Bench gain, ACE online-adaptation
scenarios); monetization via a managed cloud (Engram-style). Consequences:
multi-tenancy/isolation/metering are first-class from day one; everything in
the repo is written as if public (with D-003 hygiene); the control plane is a
separate future codebase (RFC §14); license choice is OQ-5, decided when the
gate is in sight.
